The Character: Babel the Signal-Bot

Babel is a small, retro-futuristic robot floating in a digital "Cloud Terminal." Babel’s job is to route, translate, and condense the massive amounts of data flowing through the internet.

Here is the full 24-level roadmap for **Babel’s Signal Routing**, grouped by the specialized "Modules" (APIs) Babel must activate to keep the internet flowing.

## 🛰️ Babel’s Signal-Bot: The Terminal Logs

Level instructions have to be concise and easy to understand for people who haven't use the Chrome API in the past. For the story use a language the clear and different from the API's technical aspects so that player don't get confused.

### Module 1: The Sensor Array (LanguageDetector)

_Babel needs to identify incoming data packets before they can be routed._

- **Level 1:** **First Contact** – Detect the language of a stray data packet to find its origin.
- **Level 2:** **Signal Strength** – Extract the confidence score to ensure the signal isn't just background noise.
- **Level 3:** **Multi-Channel** – A packet contains two languages; Babel must identify the primary one to route it correctly.

### Module 2: The Universal Bridge (Translator)

_Babel connects nodes that don't speak the same digital tongue._

- **Level 4:** **The European Link** – Translate a status report from French to English to update the central core.
- **Level 5:** **The Asian Gateway** – Enable a bridge between a Japanese server and a Spanish client.
- **Level 6:** **Streaming Translation** – Handle a continuous stream of text to keep a live chat node active.

### Module 3: Data Compaction (Summarizer)

_The buffers are full! Babel must shrink massive logs into digestible pings._

- **Level 7:** **The Log Vacuum** – Condense a 1000-line server error log into a one-sentence "Headline."
- **Level 8:** **The Executive Summary** – Turn a long technical documentation packet into a "TL;DR" for the human admins.
- **Level 9:** **Teaser Mode** – Create a "Short" summary for a series of blog-post data packets.
- **Level 10:** Decoding the Upgrade Manual
  The Cloud Terminal is ready for a massive upgrade, but the instructions are buried in a massive, encrypted system log. To proceed to **Module 4 (Proofreader)** and beyond, Babel must summarize the manual to find the "Overclocking Toggles."

  However, Babel detects that its **Writing and Synthesis circuits** are currently offline. You must manually toggle the hardware switches in your "Host System" (Chrome) to unlock the rest of the game.

### Module 4: Protocol Refinement (Proofreader)

_Data corruption is causing typos. Babel must clean the signal._

- **Level 11:** **Syntax Scrub** – Detect and fix grammar errors in a system announcement.
- **Level 12:** **Formal Handshake** – Use the proofreader to ensure a message to the "Mainframe" is professionally written.
- **Level 13:** **The Dirty Buffer** – Clean up a user-submitted comment that has messy punctuation.

### Module 15: Signal Synthesis (Writer)

_Babel must generate new data packets from scratch based on local prompts._

- **Level 14:** **The Welcome Ping** – Generate a welcoming message for a new user connecting to the terminal.
- **Level 15:** **Status Report Generator** – Create a structured paragraph explaining why a specific server is offline.
- **Level 16:** **The Lore Bot** – Write a short back-story for a mysterious "Ghost in the Machine" discovered in the cloud.

### Module 6: Signal Transformation (Rewriter)

_Babel must change the "flavor" of the data without losing the meaning._

- **Level 17:** **The Friendly Bot** – Rewrite a cold, robotic error message to sound more "User Friendly."
- **Level 18:** **The Concise Node** – Take a long-winded system explanation and rewrite it to be as short as possible.
- **Level 19:** **Technical Shift** – Rewrite a layman’s description of a bug into a formal "Bug Report" tone.

### Module 7: The Core Intelligence (Prompt API)

_Babel accesses the Gemini Nano core to solve complex logic and routing puzzles._

- **Level 20:** **The Logic Gate** – Prompt Babel to solve a logic puzzle that unlocks a secure data vault.
- **Level 21:** **The Creative Spark** – Ask Babel to come up with a creative name for a new sub-network.
- **Level 22:** **Data Classification** – Provide Babel with raw data and ask it to categorize it into "Safe," "Risky," or "Malware."
- **Level 23:** **Code Helper** – Ask Babel to explain a snippet of code found in a corrupted sector.
- **Level 24:** **Simulation Mode** – Have Babel roleplay as a vintage 1970s computer to bypass an old firewall.
- **Level 25:** **The Singularity** – A final open-ended prompt: Babel must decide how to save the Cloud Terminal from a total system collapse.
